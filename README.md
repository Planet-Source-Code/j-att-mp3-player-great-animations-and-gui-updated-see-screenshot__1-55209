### Description

This is my first submission. Its an mp3 player(almost complete) that utilizes the fmod sound engine. The GUI is one of the best on psc for this type project. I submitted it in hopes of recieveing tips on coding and reports of any bugs it has, but if you like it or it gives you some ideas then throw me a vote.

UPDATE: I have uploaded a few additions such as tooltips, a few bug fixes, an audio balance control, and playlist support. Its still a little buggy but i wont be able to update for a while so i figured what the hell.

NOTE: I could not include the outdated fmod dll an ocx but thanks to Sebastian Mares they are now available at http://www.transilvania2000.com/fmod.zip
