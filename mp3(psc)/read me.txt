This project (my first submission) is mainly an example to show what quality graphic user interface vb is capable of(with the help of Adobe Photoshop).  I do not claim that this code is the most optimized or efficient, or even that it is all mine. For this reason i would like to thank the developers of yar interactive for their polygon animation engine. There is some source code in this project that probably came from other submissions but it has been so heavily modified and in my library for so long that i have lost the authors' names.  A main reason i decided to submit this is because i would like to have other sources for error reporting or constructive criticism, so i would appreciate a comment or two.  If you like it, please throw a vote my way.  ps sorry about the lack of comments
